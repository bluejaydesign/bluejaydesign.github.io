His initial ambition when joining the fab lab was to combine his understanding of traditional boat composition, with modern fabrication technologies. Translating ship loftings and lines plans into 3 dimensional forms would both be considered an important aspect of expressing such an understanding. It was this personal goal that sparked his initial motivation to join the fab lab.</p>
